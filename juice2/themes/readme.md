# Themes

Themes are a bundle of CSS sheets and components that you can utilize into the berilliumCSS core. This provides designers more breadth of design and developers more speed. Paired with berilliumCSS, themes are a great way to create consistent and beautiful user interfaces while minimizing the need for custom CSS.
