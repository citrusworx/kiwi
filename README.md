# Kiwi Engine

Welcome to Kiwi Engine. The name can be, somewhat, misleading. You can part this engine out
for your particular needs. You do not have to use the engine in its entirety (you can if you'd like).
Kiwi Engine is designed to fill in the gaps for what you are lacking or a complete application engine.

## Standardized

Each of the modules that compose Kiwi Engine can be plugged into other projects and work seamlessly. This
is a design feature. We want our modules to not only be compatible with each other but with other libraries
as well. 

## CLI Tool

citrusCLI is a great way to get **exactly** what you need for your projects without the bloat. If you just need
a CSS file for some colors you can pull that one file. You can also scaffold complete projects using Kiwi Engine.
